## Project Planning

### Overview

_**News Reader** is an app that will let people search for news. It will allow people to look up any search terms and return relevant articles. It can return articles only from the US or it can return articles from all around the world. It will pull data from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)._

<br>

### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views.

### MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned and easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex.

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    App    | functional |   y   |   y   | _The file in which everything will stem from._               |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   y   | _Will be the header area of the page, including app title and search bar._               |
|    SiteTitle    | functional |   n   |   y   | _Will be the title of the site itself. Will be rendered inside the header._               |
|    SearchBar    | functional |   n   |   y   | _The search bar. Will be rendered inside the header._               |
|    Page    | functional |   n   |   y   | _Essentially the main content container._               |
|    NewsCard    | functional |   n   |   y   | _Will contain the contents of a given news article, including title, author, source, and article description or contents preview._               |
|    _    | functional |   n   |   y   | __               |
|    _    | functional |   n   |   y   | __               |
|    _    | functional |   n   |   y   | __               |
|    _    | functional |   n   |   y   | __               |


<br>

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above. 
>
> Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

<br>

#### Helper Functions

> Use this section to document all helper functionsâ€“ generic functions that can be reused in other applications.

|  Function  | Description                                |
| :--------: | :----------------------------------------- |
| Capitalize | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

<br>

### Post-MVP

> Use this section to document ideas you've had that would be fun (or necessary) for your Post-MVP. This will be helpful when you return to your project after graduation!

- _Add user account and auth capabilities._
- _Utilize the Giphy API to welcome new users with funny gifs._
